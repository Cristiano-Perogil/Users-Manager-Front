# <p align='center'>Users Manager Front</p>

This project gives an interface as an example on how to use [Users Manager API application](https://github.com/Cristiano-Perogil/user-manager-api). From its main interface, you can view all the users stored within the database, as well as performing CRUD operations on it (add, delete, edit...)

## Setting Up

Running it is as simple as it is supposed to be, you just need to clone it, install its dependencies by running `npm i` / `yarn` on its root directory. Once all the previous is complete, run `npm run dev` / `yarn dev`, hold on a sec, press o then enter and that's it. Your browser should open the project loaded.

## Technologies Used

1. React
2. React-Redux
3. Fontawesome
3. Vite

### OBS

For some of you, it might be unnecessary using redux here, nevertheless I learned it and thought it would be a great way of putting it into practice, so don't worry, I'm aware the state managed by redux, in this case, is completely handled by react alone.
